##### About Me
I love writing software to try and make the world a better, more livable place.
I try to write clean, reusable, well-tested code, and rely heavily on the 
[numerical Python stack](https://www.numfocus.org/) and the Python open source
community at large. I studied City Planning and Transportation Engineering
at UC-Berkeley, and currently live in Oakland, CA.
